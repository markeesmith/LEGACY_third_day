                <h3>"...look no further than Third Day Builders/Kevin Weaver!"</h3>
                <p>"If you are looking for a quality built, custom home or meticulous handyman, look no further than Third Day Builders/Kevin Weaver!</p>
                <p>In 2007 I approached Kevin Weaver wanting to build a new home with a custom look in Harpers Ferry.  Kevin and his team came out and completely surpassed all my expectations.  I have had 3 brand new homes in my life, and never saw the superiority of a Third Day home.  Over 10 years later, my home still does not have the settling cracks or nail pops that others have had.</p>
                <p>If you want involvement, look no further.  Kevin will keep you in the loop as far as status and projects coming up.  Kevin gets nearly as excited as his buyer when going through the building process and keeps the buyer "in the know" of current standings and where things are at.</p>
                <p>You can literally drive through Jefferson County, and point out a Third Day home.  They all have "a look" that is upscale and stately while having a comfortable atmosphere that makes you want to never leave.</p>
                <p>Since my home was built, I have also contacted Kevin for side projects to customize my home and keep it with the latest trends.  Kevin has installed shiplap in my 2 story foyer, installed a custom backsplash in my kitchen, among many other smaller projects.  He always stays within the budget laid out before the project and finishes before the timeline established.</p>
                <p>In my mind, there is no other person in the surrounding area that I want doing any of my work, and hopefully you will give him a call to obtain the same satisfaction!"</p>
